N persons are standing in a circle. They are labelled from 1 to N in clockwise order. 
Every one of them is holding a gun and can shoot a person on his left. 
Starting from person 1, they starts shooting in order e.g for N=100, person 1 shoots person 2, then person 3 shoots person 4, 
then person 5 shoots person 6……..then person 99 shoots person 100, then person 1 shoots person 3, then person 5 shoots person 7
……and it continues till all are dead except one.
What’s the index of that last person ?
