There is a bus with 100 labeled seats (labeled from 1 to 100). There are 100 persons standing in a queue. 
Persons are also labelled from 1 to 100.
People board on the bus in sequence from 1 to n. The rule is, if person ‘i’ boards the bus, he checks if seat ‘i’ is empty.
If it is empty, he sits there, else he randomly picks an empty seat and sit there. 
Given that 1st person picks seat randomly, find the probability that 100th person sits on his place i.e. 100th seat.
