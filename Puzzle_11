You are in a dark room where a table is kept. There are 50 coins placed on the table,
out of which 10 coins are showing tails and 40 coins are showing heads. 
The task is to divide this set of 50 coins into 2 groups (not necessarily same size) 
such that both groups have same number of coins showing the tails.
