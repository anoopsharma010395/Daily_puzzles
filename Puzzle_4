How can you represent days of month using two 6 sided dice?
You can write one number on each face of the dice from 0 to 9 and you have to represent days from 1 to 31,
for example for 1, one dice should show 0 and another should show 1, similarly for 29 
one dice should show 2 and another should show 9.
