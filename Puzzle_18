A king wants his daughter to marry one of 3 young princes, so he devises an intelligence test.
The princes are gathered into a room and are shown 2 black hats and 3 white hats. 
They are blindfolded, and 1 hat is placed on each of their heads, with the remaining hats hidden in a different room.
The king tells them that the first prince to deduce the color of his hat without removing it or 
looking at it will marry his daughter. A wrong guess will mean death. The blindfolds are then removed.
You are one of the princes. You see 2 white hats on the other princeâ€™s heads. 
After some time you realize that the other princes are unable to guess the color of their hat. 
What is the color of your hat?
